# Build and style layout for media-service provider

## Story

Your mission is to design the architecture of a Media Service provider system. You definitely know platforms such as Netflix, HBO GO, Amazon Prime etc.
During the Project Planning Meeting, you have to design a software prototype and then implement HTML structure with all CSS styles. Please keep in your mind front-end and back-end functionalities, as well as good UI/UX practises.

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn:

- implementing app layout based on prototype,
- working with prototyping tools, AdobeXD, Figma,
- how to compose code from the prototype to HTML views.


## Tasks

1. Create a list of views for the current version of your Media Service project that you will have to implement in the next step.
    - Just simply go through what you have already done and focus on the user interface that should be connected with your user stories. 
How does the list might look like?
- login page,
- dashboard with a menu,
- film list,
- add new or edit movie form,
- users list
- etc, etc...

Make sure you list all necessary views. It's a kind of work plan for your team.

2. Create mockups for every necessary view. 
    - You should use free `AdobeXD` or `Figma`, because these are the most popular platforms for creating app mockups used by many companies.
    - Try to design user-friendly layouts and collect feedback about UX from your other teams. Try to use one of these tools as a one of planning platform.

3. Implement views which you've already designed as a prototype. 
    - Start a new branch named views and put all HTML and CSS files in there. 
Probably you'll implement very similar views. To avoid repeated HTML code, you can include HTML snippets: Include HTML
    - It's important now to create a page with sample data (without connection with backend).
    - Your implementation should be responsive, so check if it displays correctly on different platforms. Use CSS best practises, pseudoclasses, flex and grid.
