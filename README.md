# Turn prototype into live web app

## Story

As a programmer school, we want to monitor the current skills of our programmers. In the best efficient way, we need a system for managing our students, future employees, their skills, monitoring current IT market, averages salaries, etc. Our project designer has delivered us a basic concept which we decided to implement. This task is to create an HTML structure and style it appropriately using CSS based on the following views and the prototype created in AdobeXD. 

Below you can see the exported sample design.

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn:

- how to implement app layout based on a prototype
- working with prototyping tools, AdobeXD
- composeing code from the prototype to HTML views

## Tasks

1. See the created sample.
    - Please go to the, where you can find export prototype generated from AdobeXD software:
**[AdobeXD prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/62401377-7c58-4d2e-8284-b77adfeadae9-3713/)**

2. Based on the given prototyp build appropriate HTML.
    - Create site skeleton consisting of HTML5 tags

3. Inspect AdobeXD project to get some assets, references and style code.

    - Avoid positioning elements with position relative or absolute.
    - build the whole structure based on flex and grid.

4. It will be good to use this application not only on computers, 
but also on mobile devices. Our graphic designer has designed appropriate views for smartphones. 
    - Please implement them using CSS media queries. If in the previous step you used flex or grid, 
then it will be easier to mock the same layout on mobile devices.
    - You can use browser Inspector to check how it looks on different platforms. 
To do that please click `right mouse button` choose `inspect` and go to `toggle device toolbar`.
